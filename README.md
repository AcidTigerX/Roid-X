## Overview

- **Concept:** AcidTigerX
- **Developed by:** Grok (xAI)
- **Version:** 0.5 Alpha
- **Date:** February 23, 2025 (current development date)

This game features a player-controlled spaceship with advanced movement mechanics, enemy AI, asteroid physics, and a variety of power-ups to enhance gameplay. Itâ€™s designed as a single HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript, making it easy to run in any modern browser.

## Features

3. Assets:
        Ensure the assets/ folder contains all required images (listed below).
        Missing assets will cause errors or blank visuals.

Running on GitHub Pages

    Deploy:
        Push the repo to GitHub.
        Go to Settings > Pages, set the source to "main" branch, "/ (root)" folder.
    Access:
        Visit https://<your-username>.github.io/RoidX/ after deployment.

Required Assets

Place these in an assets/ folder in the root directory:

    player_ship_1.png
    asteroid_1.png to asteroid_10.png
    gold_asteroid_1.png to gold_asteroid_3.png
    enemy_ship_1.png to enemy_ship_4.png
    bullet.png
    power_up.png

Note: If assets are unavailable, replace image sources with hosted URLs (e.g., Imgur links).
Controls

    Movement:
        A: Rotate left
        D: Rotate right
        W: Thrust forward
        S: Thrust reverse
        Q: Strafe left
        E: Strafe right
    Combat:
        Space: Shoot
    Debug:
        H: Toggle debug mode (shows hitboxes)

Game Mechanics

    Shields:
        Inner shield (7 HP) and optional second shield (7 HP) absorb damage.
        Player dies only when both shields are depleted.
    Enemy Collision:
        Shielded player vs. shielded enemy: Enemy bounces off, player shield takes 1 damage.
        Shielded player vs. unshielded enemy: Enemy destroyed, player shield takes 1 damage.
        Unshielded player vs. shielded enemy: Player dies.
    Asteroids:
        Large asteroids (75% or 100% scale) split into smaller ones and a gold asteroid when destroyed.
        Small asteroids (25% scale) despawn after 5 seconds.
    Power-Ups:
        Collectible items enhance gameplay; some can be jammed by enemies and unjammed by special power-ups.
